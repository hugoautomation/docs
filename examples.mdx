## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Token authentication. You must include an API token in the `Authorization` header for all requests.

### To Get Your Token

1. Log in to your [dashboard](https://api.anyoutfit.ai)
2. Navigate to the "Access Token" section
3. Generate a new token

### To Use Your Token

Include your token in the `Authorization` header of your API requests as follows:

```json
headers = {
  "Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_TOKEN",
  "accept": "application/json",
  "content-type": "application/json"
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with the actual token you have generated. If your generated token is 'AjjhfI30884KNNsuu40975N',
your header becomes:

```json
headers = {
  "Authorization": "Token AjjhfI30884KNNsuu40975N",
  "accept": "application/json",
  "content-type": "application/json"
}
```
