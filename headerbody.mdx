title: 'Headers and bodies'

When you have your API token, it remains to call our API endpoint 'https://api.anyoutfit.ai/api/create_photo_shoot/' via a **POST** request with :
### headers (using your token):

```json
headers = {
  "Authorization": "Token AjjhfI30884KNNsuu40975N",
  "accept": "application/json",
  "content-type": "application/json"
}
```
### body without model
In that case, anyoutfit will first generate a human model according to your description in the text prompt then create a photoshoot:
```json
body = {
  "text_prompt": "A young asian woman in a busy street",
  "garment_image_url": "https://example.com/blue_shirt.jpg",
  "category": "top",
  "model_image_url": "",
}
```
### body with model
In that case, anyoutfit will use your model to create a photoshoot:
```json
body = {
  "text_prompt": "",
  "garment_image_url": "https://example.com/blue_shirt.jpg",
  "category": "top",
  "model_image_url": "https://example.com/model.jpg",
}
```
